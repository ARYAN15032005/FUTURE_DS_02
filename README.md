# Power BI Campaign Performance Dashboard

This project was developed during my **second internship** at **Future Interns** as part of my learning and real-world application of data analysis and business intelligence skills using Power BI.

## 🔍 Project Summary

The dashboard provides performance insights into a digital marketing campaign dataset, helping stakeholders understand engagement, ROI, and customer segmentation across various dimensions like age, gender, channel, and campaign type.

## 📌 Key Features

- Custom visuals with slicers for Age, Gender, Campaign Type, Location, Channel Used
- KPIs: Acquisition Cost, Clicks, Impressions, ROI
- Breakdown of campaign effectiveness by channel and type
- Geo-mapped customer clicks (Location-wise)
- Time-series analysis of impressions and clicks across months
- Gender-wise engagement across customer segments
